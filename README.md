# Loaning-system
It is a C program
It asks 1 for borrowing and 2 for lending
Please fill the the required the details
after one time it would ask 1 for continue and -1 for termination
at the end it displays all lender and borrowers

Few modifications I would like to propose:
- After the program ends the data is lost. So txt files could be used for writing the current status of lenders and borrowers.
- Besides other databases like sql and webframe work like nodejs and django might help in better managment

The loaning system is centralised cause. I am the only one looking at the borrowers and lenders data.
I the borrower says he borrowed 1000 money no one except me could gurantee that. The demerits of centralised system include 
- Only a few people have control
- Less transparency 
- The trust has to be given to centralised body
